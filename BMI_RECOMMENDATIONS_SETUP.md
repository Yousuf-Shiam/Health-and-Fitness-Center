## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Edamam API Credentials
1. Visit [Edamam Developer Portal](https://developer.edamam.com/)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Create a new application
4. Select "Meal Planner API"
5. Copy your APP_ID and APP_KEY

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Update your `.env` file in the backend directory:
```
EDAMAM_APP_ID=your_actual_app_id_here
EDAMAM_APP_KEY=your_actual_app_key_here
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd backend
npm install axios
```

### 4. Database Schema Updates
The user model now includes additional fields:
- `height`: Number (cm)
- `weight`: Number (kg)
- `bmi`: Number (calculated)
- `age`: Number
- `gender`: String (male/female/other)

## API Endpoints

### GET `/api/recommendations/bmi-recommendations`
Returns comprehensive recommendations including:
- BMI calculation and category
- Diet recommendations
- Exercise recommendations
- Lifestyle recommendations
- Personalized meal plan (if Edamam API is available)
- Nutrition and supplement suggestions

### PUT `/api/recommendations/physical-data`
Updates user's physical information:
```json
{
  "height": 175,
  "weight": 70,
  "age": 25,
  "gender": "male"
}
```

## Frontend Features

### BMI Dashboard (`/bmi-recommendations`)
- **Physical Data Form**: Update height, weight, age, gender
- **BMI Display**: Large, color-coded BMI value with category
- **Recommendation Cards**: Organized sections for different types of recommendations
- **Meal Plan Display**: 7-day meal plan with nutritional information
- **Error Handling**: Fallback recommendations when APIs are unavailable

### Navigation Integration
- Added "BMI & Health Tips" button to client navigation
- Protected route requiring authentication
- Responsive design matching existing app theme

## Recommendation Algorithm

### Calorie Calculation
Uses Mifflin-St Jeor Equation:
- **Men**: BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 Ã— weight) + (4.799 Ã— height) - (5.677 Ã— age)
- **Women**: BMR = 447.593 + (9.247 Ã— weight) + (3.098 Ã— height) - (4.330 Ã— age)

Activity multipliers based on BMI category:
- Underweight: 1.6 (more calories for weight gain)
- Normal: 1.4 (moderate activity)
- Overweight: 1.3 (slight reduction for weight loss)
- Obese: 1.2 (lower for weight loss)

### Health Labels Selection
Based on BMI category, the system automatically selects appropriate Edamam health labels:
- **Underweight**: balanced, high-protein
- **Normal**: balanced, Mediterranean
- **Overweight**: balanced, low-sodium, sugar-conscious
- **Obese**: balanced, low-sodium, sugar-conscious, low-fat

## Error Handling & Fallbacks

### API Failure Handling
- Fallback meal suggestions when Edamam API is unavailable
- Default nutrition and exercise tips
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful degradation of features

### Data Validation
- Input validation for height (100-250 cm) and weight (30-300 kg)
- Age validation (13-100 years)
- Gender selection validation
- BMI calculation error handling

## Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. **Profile Update**: Navigate to BMI & Health Tips from the sidebar
2. **Enter Physical Data**: Add height, weight, age, and gender
3. **View Recommendations**: Get personalized diet, exercise, and meal recommendations
4. **Update Data**: Modify physical information anytime to get updated recommendations

### For Developers
1. **API Integration**: Replace demo API keys with real Edamam credentials
2. **Customization**: Modify recommendation algorithms in `recommendationController.js`
3. **UI Enhancement**: Update styles and components in `BMIRecommendations.js`
4. **Additional APIs**: Integrate more health and fitness APIs for enhanced recommendations

## Security Considerations
- All API endpoints are protected with JWT authentication
- User data is stored securely in MongoDB
- Environment variables protect sensitive API keys
- Input validation prevents invalid data submission

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with fitness tracking APIs
- Meal plan export functionality
- Progress tracking over time
- Social features for sharing achievements
- Professional consultation booking
- Grocery list generation from meal plans

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **API Errors**: Check that Edamam API credentials are correctly set
2. **Missing Data**: Ensure height and weight are provided before getting recommendations
3. **Network Issues**: System falls back to default recommendations when APIs are unavailable
4. **Authentication**: Verify JWT token is valid and user is logged in

### Testing
- Test with different BMI categories to see varied recommendations
- Verify fallback behavior when API is unavailable
- Check responsive design on different screen sizes
- Validate form input handling and error messages
