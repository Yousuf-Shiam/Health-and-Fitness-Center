# 🔧 Fixed: Edamam API 404 Error

## ✅ **Problem Identified & Solved**

### **The Issue:**
- **404 Error**: "Request failed with status code 404"
- **Root Cause**: Environment variables not loading properly in the controller
- **Evidence**: Controller showed "App ID: your_app_id_here" instead of real credentials

### **The Fix:**
1. **Environment Loading Issue**: Controller was loaded before `dotenv.config()` ran
2. **Solution**: Changed to dynamic credential loading using `getEdamamCredentials()`
3. **URL Correction**: Fixed API endpoint to use correct base URL
4. **Clean .env**: Removed comments and extra spaces that could cause parsing issues

## 🎯 **Current Status:**

✅ **Environment Variables**: Now loading correctly (`EDAMAM_APP_ID: 7bb50200`)  
✅ **Backend Server**: Running on port 5000  
✅ **MongoDB**: Connected successfully  
✅ **API Integration**: Ready for testing
