{
  "size": 7, // 7-day meal plan
  "plan": {
    "fit": {
      "ENERC_KCAL": { "min": 1200, "max": 2000 },

### Calorie Calculation Algorithm
```javascript
// Mifflin-St Jeor Equation
Male BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 × weight) + (4.799 × height) - (5.677 × age)
Female BMR = 447.593 + (9.247 × weight) + (3.098 × height) - (4.330 × age)

// Activity multipliers by BMI category:
Underweight: BMR × 1.6
Normal: BMR × 1.4
Overweight: BMR × 1.3
Obese: BMR × 1.2
```
